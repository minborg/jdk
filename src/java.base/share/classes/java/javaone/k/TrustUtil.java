    JDK 25     : an instance field that is declared `final` AND (
                 - the holding class is a `record` or a hidden class OR
                 - the holding class is an internal JDK class and the field is annotated with `@Stable` )

    JDK 25 + N : an instance field is `final`.

    Note: Method references are implemented using hidden classes.
    Note: Immutable collections like Set.of(), Map.of(), Collectors.toUnmodifiableX, etc.
          are backed by `@Stable` fields.

    Examples for JDK 25 where

      - `x` is a `final` instance field in a normal or anonymous class)
